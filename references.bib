abstract = {In this study, two probabilistic machine-learning algorithms were compared for in silico target prediction of bioactive molecules, namely the well-established Laplacian-modified Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes classifier ({\{}NB){\}} and the more recently introduced (to Cheminformatics) Parzen-Rosenblatt Window. Both classifiers were trained in conjunction with circular fingerprints on a large data set of bioactive compounds extracted from {\{}ChEMBL{\}}, covering 894 human protein targets with more than 155,000 ligand-protein pairs. This data set is also provided as a benchmark data set for future target prediction methods due to its size as well as the number of bioactivity classes it contains. In addition to evaluating the methods, different performance measures were explored. This is not as straightforward as in binary classification settings, due to the number of classes, the possibility of multiple class memberships, and the need to translate model scores into ?yes/no? predictions for assessing model performance. Both algorithms achieved a recall of correct targets that exceeds 80{\%} in the top 1{\%} of predictions. Performance depends significantly on the underlying diversity and size of a given class of bioactive compounds, with small classes and low structural similarity affecting both algorithms to different degrees. When tested on an external test set extracted from {\{}WOMBAT{\}} covering more than 500 targets by excluding all compounds with Tanimoto similarity above 0.8 to compounds from the {\{}ChEMBL{\}} data set, the current methodologies achieved a recall of 63.3{\%} and 66.6{\%} among the top 1{\%} for Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes and Parzen-Rosenblatt Window, respectively. While those numbers seem to indicate lower performance, they are also more realistic for settings where protein targets need to be established for novel chemical substances.},

abstract = {The statistical metrics used to characterize the external predictivity of a model, i.e., how well it predicts the properties of an independent test set, have proliferated over the past decade. This paper clarifies some apparent confusion over the use of the coefficient of determination, R(2), as a measure of model fit and predictive power in QSAR and QSPR modeling. R(2) (or r(2)) has been used in various contexts in the literature in conjunction with training and test data for both ordinary linear regression and regression through the origin as well as with linear and nonlinear regression models. We analyze the widely adopted model fit criteria suggested by Golbraikh and Tropsha ( J. Mol. Graphics Modell. 2002 , 20 , 269 - 276 ) in a strict statistical manner. Shortcomings in these criteria are identified, and a clearer and simpler alternative method to characterize model predictivity is provided. The intent is not to repeat the well-documented arguments for model validation using test data but rather to guide the application of R(2) as a model fit statistic. Examples are used to illustrate both correct and incorrect uses of R(2). Reporting the root-mean-square error or equivalent measures of dispersion, which are typically of more practical importance than R(2), is also encouraged, and important challenges in addressing the needs of different categories of users such as computational chemists, experimental scientists, and regulatory decision support specialists are outlined.},

We describe AVE, a new measure of trainingâ€“validation redundancy for ligand-based classification problems, that accounts for the similarity among inactive molecules as well as active ones. We investigated seven widely used benchmarks for virtual screening and classification, and we show that the amount of AVE bias strongly correlates with the performance of ligand-based predictive methods irrespective of the predicted property, chemical fingerprint, similarity measure, or previously applied unbiasing techniques. Therefore, it may be the case that the previously reported performance of most ligand-based methods can be explained by overfitting to benchmarks rather than good prospective accuracy.},

@article{OBoyle2016,
abstract = {BACKGROUND The concept of molecular similarity is one of the central ideas in cheminformatics, despite the fact that it is ill-defined and rather difficult to assess objectively. Here we propose a practical definition of molecular similarity in the context of drug discovery: molecules A and B are similar if a medicinal chemist would be likely to synthesise and test them around the same time as part of the same medicinal chemistry program. The attraction of such a definition is that it matches one of the key uses of similarity measures in early-stage drug discovery. If we make the assumption that molecules in the same compound activity table in a medicinal chemistry paper were considered similar by the authors of the paper, we can create a dataset of similar molecules from the medicinal chemistry literature. Furthermore, molecules with decreasing levels of similarity to a reference can be found by either ordering molecules in an activity table by their activity, or by considering activity tables in different papers which have at least one molecule in common. RESULTS Using this procedure with activity data from ChEMBL, we have created two benchmark datasets for structural similarity that can be used to guide the development of improved measures. Compared to similar results from a virtual screen, these benchmarks are an order of magnitude more sensitive to differences between fingerprints both because of their size and because they avoid loss of statistical power due to the use of mean scores or ranks. We measure the performance of 28 different fingerprints on the benchmark sets and compare the results to those from the Riniker and Landrum (J Cheminf 5:26, 2013. doi:10.1186/1758-2946-5-26) ligand-based virtual screening benchmark. CONCLUSIONS Extended-connectivity fingerprints of diameter 4 and 6 are among the best performing fingerprints when ranking diverse structures by similarity, as is the topological torsion fingerprint. However, when ranking very close analogues, the atom pair fingerprint outperforms the others tested. When ranking diverse structures or carrying out a virtual screen, we find that the performance of the ECFP fingerprints significantly improves if the bit-vector length is increased from 1024 to 16,384.Graphical abstractAn example series from one of the benchmark datasets.

@article{Bajusz2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND Cheminformaticians are equipped with a very rich toolbox when carrying out molecular similarity calculations. A large number of molecular representations exist, and there are several methods (similarity and distance metrics) to quantify the similarity of molecular representations. In this work, eight well-known similarity/distance metrics are compared on a large dataset of molecular fingerprints with sum of ranking differences (SRD) and ANOVA analysis. The effects of molecular size, selection methods and data pretreatment methods on the outcome of the comparison are also assessed. RESULTS A supplier database (https://mcule.com/) was used as the source of compounds for the similarity calculations in this study. A large number of datasets, each consisting of one hundred compounds, were compiled, molecular fingerprints were generated and similarity values between a randomly chosen reference compound and the rest were calculated for each dataset. Similarity metrics were compared based on their ranking of the compounds within one experiment (one dataset) using sum of ranking differences (SRD), while the results of the entire set of experiments were summarized on box and whisker plots. Finally, the effects of various factors (data pretreatment, molecule size, selection method) were evaluated with analysis of variance (ANOVA). CONCLUSIONS This study complements previous efforts to examine and rank various metrics for molecular similarity calculations. Here, however, an entirely general approach was taken to neglect any a priori knowledge on the compounds involved, as well as any bias introduced by examining only one or a few specific scenarios. The Tanimoto index, Dice index, Cosine coefficient and Soergel distance were identified to be the best (and in some sense equivalent) metrics for similarity calculations, i.e. these metrics could produce the rankings closest to the composite (average) ranking of the eight metrics. The similarity metrics derived from Euclidean and Manhattan distances are not recommended on their own, although their variability and diversity from other similarity metrics might be advantageous in certain cases (e.g. for data fusion). Conclusions are also drawn regarding the effects of molecule size, selection method and data pretreatment on the ranking behavior of the studied metrics.

@article{Bender2004b,
abstract = {Molecular Informatics utilises many ideas and concepts to find relationships between molecules. The concept of similarity, where molecules may be grouped according to their biological effects or physicochemical properties has found extensive use in drug discovery. Some areas of particular interest have been in lead discovery and compound optimisation. For example, in designing libraries of compounds for lead generation, one approach is to design sets of compounds "similar" to known active compounds in the hope that alternative molecular structures are found that maintain the properties required while enhancing e.g. patentability, medicinal chemistry opportunities or even in achieving optimised pharmacokinetic profiles. Thus the practical importance of the concept of molecular similarity has grown dramatically in recent years. The predominant users are pharmaceutical companies, employing similarity methods in a wide range of applications e.g. virtual screening, estimation of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADME/Tox) and prediction of physicochemical properties (solubility, partitioning etc.). In this perspective, we discuss the representation of molecular structure (descriptors), methods of comparing structures and how these relate to measured properties. This leads to the concept of molecular similarity, its various definitions and uses and how these have evolved in recent years. Here, we wish to evaluate and in some cases challenge accepted views and uses of molecular similarity. Molecular similarity, as a paradigm, contains many implicit and explicit assumptions in particular with respect to the prediction of the binding and efficacy of molecules at biological receptors. The fundamental observation is that molecular similarity has a context which both defines and limits its use. The key issues of solvation effects, heterogeneity of binding sites and the fundamental problem of the form of similarity measure to use are addressed.},

abstract = {The biochemical half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) is the most commonly used metric for on-target activity in lead optimization. It is used to guide lead optimization, build large-scale chemogenomics analysis, off-target activity and toxicity models based on public data. However, the use of public biochemical IC50 data is problematic, because they are assay specific and comparable only under certain conditions. For large scale analysis it is not feasible to check each data entry manually and it is very tempting to mix all available IC50 values from public database even if assay information is not reported. As previously reported for Ki database analysis, we first analyzed the types of errors, the redundancy and the variability that can be found in ChEMBL IC50 database. For assessing the variability of IC50 data independently measured in two different labs at least ten IC50 data for identical protein-ligand systems against the same target were searched in ChEMBL. As a not sufficient number of cases of this type are available, the variability of IC50 data was assessed by comparing all pairs of independent IC50 measurements on identical protein-ligand systems. The standard deviation of IC50 data is only 25{\%} larger than the standard deviation of Ki data, suggesting that mixing IC50 data from different assays, even not knowing assay conditions details, only adds a moderate amount of noise to the overall data. The standard deviation of public ChEMBL IC50 data, as expected, resulted greater than the standard deviation of in-house intra-laboratory/inter-day IC50 data. Augmenting mixed public IC50 data by public Ki data does not deteriorate the quality of the mixed IC50 data, if the Ki is corrected by an offset. For a broad dataset such as ChEMBL database a Ki- IC50 conversion factor of 2 was found to be the most reasonable.},

@article{Davies2015,
abstract = {ChEMBL is now a well-established resource in the fields of drug discovery and medicinal chemistry research. The ChEMBL database curates and stores standardized bioactivity, molecule, target and drug data extracted from multiple sources, including the primary medicinal chemistry literature. Programmatic access to ChEMBL data has been improved by a recent update to the ChEMBL web services (version 2.0.x, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/api/data/docs), which exposes significantly more data from the underlying database and introduces new functionality. To complement the data-focused services, a utility service (version 1.0.x, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/api/utils/docs), which provides RESTful access to commonly used cheminformatics methods, has also been concurrently developed. The ChEMBL web services can be used together or independently to build applications and data processing workflows relevant to drug discovery and chemical biology.},

@article{Kang2018,
abstract = {Although machine learning has been successfully used to propose novel molecules that satisfy desired properties, it is still challenging to explore a large chemical space efficiently. In this paper, we present a conditional molecular design method that facilitates generating new molecules with desired properties. The proposed model, which simultaneously performs both property prediction and molecule generation, is built as a semi-supervised variational autoencoder trained on a set of existing molecules with only a partial annotation. We generate new molecules with desired properties by sampling from the generative distribution estimated by the model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model by evaluating it on drug-like molecules. The model improves the performance of property prediction by exploiting unlabeled molecules, and efficiently generates novel molecules fulfilling various target conditions.},

abstract = {Artificial neural networks had their first heyday in molecular informatics and drug discovery approximately two decades ago. Currently, we are witnessing renewed interest in adapting advanced neural network architectures for pharmaceutical research by borrowing from the field of "deep learning". Compared with some of the other life sciences, their application in drug discovery is still limited. Here, we provide an overview of this emerging field of molecular informatics, present the basic concepts of prominent deep learning methods and offer motivation to explore these techniques for their usefulness in computer-assisted drug discovery and design. We specifically emphasize deep neural networks, restricted Boltzmann machine networks and convolutional networks.},
